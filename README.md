## Purpose

Cervical cancer is a preventable type of cancer that affects about 11,000 women each year in the U.S. The number of new cases has been declining due to increased screening and early detection with the Pap test. However, it still kills about 4,000 women in the U.S. and 300,000 worldwide annually. Risk factors include human papillomavirus (HPV), sexual activity with infected partners, having multiple sexual partners, a history of chlamydia, long-term use of oral contraception, having many children, smoking, weak immune systems, and being exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES). While the median age of diagnosis is 48 years, 15% of women develop cervical cancer between ages 20-30. African American and Hispanic women have a higher risk of cervical cancer due to social and economic disparities that limit access to screening services. This project aims to determine the most important features in a positive cervical cancer biopsy.

## Conclusion

Overall, we do not like data we used for this project. The features were severely imbalanced, as well as the target. Consequently, the model was biased, and we were unable to find reliable feature importance comparisons. We would need to find a larger dataset with more balanced features, and a balanced target.
